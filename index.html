		<h4>Creation & Development</h4>
		<p class="para">Spider-Man bemoaned the lack of real challenges in the crooks he fought in AMAZING SPIDER-MAN #3, but soon found himself soundly thrashed by new villain Doctor Octopus. Inspired at school by a talk from the teenage Human Torch, Peter developed a new form of webbing that turned the tide in his war with Doc Ock. For his troubles, though, Jameson labeled the crusader a “menace” in AMAZING SPIDER-MAN #4, and Spidey discovered public opinion about his alter-ego to be mixed following a tough scrap with Sandman.</p>
